## Name of Project: Bitesize (using Javascript API)

This project was a Codecademy exercise that I decided to recreate in my text editor (VS Code). I thought it would be a good idea to show that I understand the concept of using an AJAX ES8 async-await **PUSH** request to use an API. 

This particular API allows you to input a URL. Then you get back a shorter version of te URL. I basically completed the challenge on the Codecademy website then rewrote the code in my own text editor using version control to document my steps. I found this useful to get a solid understanding of the process.
